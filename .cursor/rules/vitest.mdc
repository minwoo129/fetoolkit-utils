  import { chunk } from '../../src/utils/array'

  describe('array > chunk', () => {
      // add test cases for imported functions
      // Add all possible test cases by referring to the above test data generation rule
      // If there is no rule, write all possible test cases by referring to functional functions

      it('test case description', ()) => {

      })
  })
